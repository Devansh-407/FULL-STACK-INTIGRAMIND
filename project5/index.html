            <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’m a passionate B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at GLA University, driven by a strong curiosity for both technology and design. Over the past few years, I’ve been steadily building a skill set that blends web development, UI/UX design, and programming.
            <br><br>

My focus lies in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly digital experiences, whether it’s developing modern frontend interfaces, designing smooth user journeys, or writing efficient backend logic. Alongside this, I actively explore AI/ML fundamentals through online certifications, internships, and personal projects, as I believe artificial intelligence will shape the future of technology.
<br><br>

What excites me most is the opportunity to apply theory into practice—solving real-world problems, working on impactful projects, and sharing my learning journey through blogs and tutorials. From crafting student-friendly coding content to experimenting with new frameworks, I see every challenge as a chance to grow. <br>
<br>

I’m now looking forward to collaborating with like-minded developers, contributing to open-source communities, and expanding my reach in the tech ecosystem. This blog is not just a showcase of my projects, but also a space where I document my learnings, experiments, and ideas—with the hope of inspiring and helping others in their own coding journey.
